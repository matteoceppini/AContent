//About AContent
AContent is an elearning content authoring tool and repository. It can be used to author learning content that will import into many elearning environments. AContent can be used to package content as IMS Content Packages, or as IMS Common Cartridges, standards that are supported by many learning systems. It can also be used to create test and question packages, based on the IMS QTI standard. It can also be used to develop AccessForAll adapted content that produces content that will adapt to individuals based on their specific learning preferences. Via its web service, AContent integrates seamlessly with ATutor, or with other learning environments, allowing content to be searched, imported into the system, and exported back to the repository.
